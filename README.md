# UniThrist

The goal of UniThirstQ is to provide sufficient information of drink locations to users and have an easy-to-use interactive system for users to find drink locations they desire by their own criterias, most importantly nearest and quickest places. It would provide a pathway for students to review each facility and report faults if there are any.

My role in the project is to lead the team, organise all the meetings and workflow and monitor work progress. I also made FAQ and contact us page.
